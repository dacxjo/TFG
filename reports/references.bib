    abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Investigators have studied many breast diagnostic approaches, including mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, computerized tomography, positron emission tomography and biopsy. However, these techniques have some limitations such as being expensive, time consuming and not suitable for young women. Developing a high-sensitive and rapid early-stage breast cancer diagnostic method is urgent. In recent years, investigators have paid their attention in the development of biosensors to detect breast cancer using different biomarkers. Apart from biosensors and biomarkers, microwave imaging techniques have also been intensely studied as a promising diagnostic tool for rapid and cost-effective early-stage breast cancer detection. This paper aims to provide an overview on recent important achievements in breast screening methods (particularly on microwave imaging) and breast biomarkers along with biosensors for rapidly diagnosing breast cancer.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer is characterized by abnormal discontinuities in the lining cells of a woman’s milk duct. Large numbers of women die from breast cancer as a result of developing symptoms in the milk ducts. If the diagnosis is made early, the death rates can be decreased. For radiologists and physicians, manually analyzing mammography images for breast cancer become time-consuming. To prevent manual analysis and simplify the work of classification, this paper introduces a novel hybrid DenseNet121-based Extreme Learning Machine Model (ELM) for classifying breast cancer from mammogram images. The mammogram images were processed through preprocessing and data augmentation phase. The features were collected separately after the pooling and flatten layer at the first stage of the classification. Further, the features are fed as input to the proposed DenseNet121-ELM model’s fully connected layer as input. An extreme learning machine model has replaced the fully connected layer. The weights of the extreme learning machine have been updated by the AdaGrad optimization algorithm to increase the model’s robustness and performance. Due to its faster convergence speed than other optimization techniques, the AdaGrad algorithm optimization was chosen. In this research, the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset mammogram images were utilized, and the results are presented. We have considered the batch size of 32, 64, and 128 for the performance measure, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and computational time. The proposed DenseNet121+ELM model achieves 99.47\% and 99.14\% as training accuracy and testing accuracy for batch size 128. Also, it achieves specificity, sensitivity, and computational time of 99.37\%, 99.94\%, and 159.7731 minutes, respectively. Further, the comparison result of performance measures is presented for batch sizes 32, 64, and 128 to show the robustness of the proposed DenseNet121+ELM model. The automatic classification performance of the DenseNet121+ELM model has much potential to be applied to the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer.},

    abstract = {An automatic breast cancer detection and classification system plays an essential role in medical imaging applications. But accurate disease identification is one of the complicated processes due to the existence of noisy contents and irrelevant structure of the original images. In conventional works, various medical image processing techniques have been developed for accurately classifying the types of breast cancer. Still, it confronts difficulties due to the aspects of increased complexity in computations, error values, false positives, and misclassification outputs. Hence, this research work proposes to develop an optimization-based classification system for the breast cancer identification system. Here, the Gaussian filtering and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) techniques are utilized for preprocessing the original mammogram images by eliminating the noisy contents and enhancing the contrast of an image. Then, the Markov Random Adaptive Segmentation (MRAS) technique is employed for detecting the boundary region based on the random value selection. To make the classifying procedure easier, the set of features is optimally extracted from the segmented region with the help of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). In which, the global best fitness value is estimated by using the crossover, mutation, and selection operations. Finally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification technique is utilized for categorizing the image as to whether normal or abnormal with its type. The entire performance analysis of the suggested model is validated and compared using multiple measures during the evaluation. In the proposed method GA performs feature selection and prunes unnecessary features. The major goal is to improve the classification performance while reducing the number of features used. The proposed system GA-CNN provides improved performance results with a reduced error rate.The suggested GA-CNN increases accuracy (98.5), sensitivity (99.38), and specificity values (98.4) as compared to the existing technique by effectively identifying the classed label.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer has affected many women worldwide. To perform detection and classification of breast cancer many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been established because the inspection of the mammogram images by the radiologist is a difficult and time taken task. To early diagnose the disease and provide better treatment lot of CAD systems were established. There is still a need to improve existing CAD systems by incorporating new methods and technologies in order to provide more precise results. This paper aims to investigate ways to prevent the disease as well as to provide new methods of classification in order to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women’s lives. The best feature optimization is performed to classify the results accurately. The CAD system’s accuracy improved by reducing the false-positive rates.The Modified Entropy Whale Optimization Algorithm (MEWOA) is proposed based on fusion for deep feature extraction and perform the classification. In the proposed method, the fine-tuned MobilenetV2 and Nasnet Mobile are applied for simulation. The features are extracted, and optimization is performed. The optimized features are fused and optimized by using MEWOA. Finally, by using the optimized deep features, the machine learning classifiers are applied to classify the breast cancer images. To extract the features and perform the classification, three publicly available datasets are used: INbreast, MIAS, and CBIS-DDSM. The maximum accuracy achieved in INbreast dataset is 99.7\%, MIAS dataset has 99.8\% and CBIS-DDSM has 93.8\%. Finally, a comparison with other existing methods is performed, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other approaches.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women, with molecular subtypes significantly influencing prognosis and treatment strategies. Currently, identifying the molecular subtype of cancer requires a biopsy—a specialized, expensive, and time-consuming procedure, often yielding to results that must be supported with additional biopsies due to technique errors or tumor heterogeneity. This study introduces a novel approach for predicting breast cancer molecular subtypes using mammography images and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. Using the OPTIMAM imaging database, 1397 images from 660 patients were selected. The pretrained deep learning model ResNet-101 was employed to classify tumors into five subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B1, Luminal B2, HER2, and Triple Negative. Various classification strategies were studied: binary classifications (one vs. all others, specific combinations) and multi-class classification (evaluating all subtypes simultaneously). To address imbalanced data, strategies like oversampling, undersampling, and data augmentation were explored. Performance was evaluated using accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Binary classification results showed a maximum average accuracy and AUC of 79.02\% and 64.69\%, respectively, while multi-class classification achieved an average AUC of 60.62\% with oversampling and data augmentation. The most notable binary classification was HER2 vs. non-HER2, with an accuracy of 89.79\% and an AUC of 73.31\%. Binary classification for specific combinations of subtypes revealed an accuracy of 76.42\% for HER2 vs. Luminal A and an AUC of 73.04\% for HER2 vs. Luminal B1. These findings highlight the potential of mammography-based AI for non-invasive breast cancer subtype prediction, offering a promising alternative to biopsies and paving the way for personalized treatment plans.},

Accurate classification of these subtypes is crucial for optimizing treatment and improving patient outcomes. While immunohistochemistry remains the gold standard for subtyping, it is invasive and may not fully capture tumor heterogeneity. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep Learning (DL), offers a promising non-invasive alternative by analyzing medical imaging data. Methods: In this study, we propose a multimodal DL model that integrates mammography images with clinical metadata to classify breast lesions into five categories: benign, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and triple-negative. Using the publicly available Chinese Mammography Database (CMMD), our model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 4056 images from 1775 patients. Results: The proposed multimodal approach significantly outperformed a unimodal model based solely on mammography images, achieving an AUC of 88.87\% for multiclass classification of these five categories, compared to 61.3\% AUC for the unimodal model. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of multimodal AI-driven approaches for non-invasive breast cancer subtype classification, paving the way for improved diagnostic precision and personalized treatment strategies.},

Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to increase the survival rate, thereby significantly increasing patients’ lifespan. Mammography, a noninvasive imaging tool with low cost, is widely used to diagnose breast disease at an early stage due to its high sensitivity. Although some public mammography datasets are useful, there is still a lack of open access datasets that expand beyond the white population as well as missing biopsy confirmation or with unknown molecular subtypes. To fill this gap, we build a database containing two online breast mammographies. The dataset named by Chinese Mammography Database (CMMD) contains 3712 mammographies involved 1775 patients, which is divided into two branches. The first dataset CMMD1 contains 1026 cases (2214 mammographies) with biopsy confirmed type of benign or malignant tumors. The second dataset CMMD2 includes 1498 mammographies for 749 patients with known molecular subtypes. Our database is constructed to enrich the diversity of mammography data and promote the development of relevant fields.},

    abstract = {Rising breast cancer (BC) occurrence and mortality are major global concerns for women. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated superior diagnostic performance in BC classification compared to human expert readers. However, the predominant use of unimodal (digital mammography) features may limit the current performance of diagnostic models. To address this, we collected a novel multimodal dataset comprising both imaging and textual data. This study proposes a multimodal DL architecture for BC classification, utilising images (mammograms; four views) and textual data (radiological reports) from our new in-house dataset. Various augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the training data size for both imaging and textual data. We explored the performance of eleven SOTA DL architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet34, ResNet50, MobileNet-v3, EffNet-b0, EffNet-b1, EffNet-b2, EffNet-b3, EffNet-b7, and Vision Transformer (ViT)) as imaging feature extractors. For textual feature extraction, we utilised either artificial neural networks (ANNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The combined imaging and textual features were then inputted into an ANN classifier for BC classification, using the late fusion technique. We evaluated different feature extractor and classifier arrangements. The VGG19 and ANN combinations achieved the highest accuracy of 0.951. For precision, the VGG19 and ANN combination again surpassed other CNN and LSTM, ANN based architectures by achieving a score of 0.95. The best sensitivity score of 0.903 was achieved by the VGG16+LSTM. The highest F1 score of 0.931 was achieved by VGG19+LSTM. Only the VGG16+LSTM achieved the best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.937, with VGG16+LSTM closely following with a 0.929 AUC score.},

Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7\% and 1.2\% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4\% and 2.7\% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5\%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88\%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.},

Materials and Method: This is a prospective study of consecutive patients with breast cancer presenting between January 2016 and July 2017, who underwent mammography and/or ultrasound of breast and excision of the breast mass. Patients with contralateral breast mass, metastases, h/o prior cancer treatment, and other malignancies were excluded. On mammography, the presence or absence of microcalcification was noted. On ultrasound examination size, margins, microcalcification, posterior acoustic features, vascularity, and axillary nodes were assessed. Margins were categorized into circumscribed and non-circumscribed. Posterior acoustic features were classified into four categories: shadowing, enhancement, mixed, and no changes. Vascularity was assessed based on Adler's index into grades 0, 1, 2, and 3. Grades 0 and 1 were considered low and 2 and 3 were high. Results: Tumors with non-circumscribed margins and posterior acoustic shadowing were likely to be luminal A or B subtype of breast cancer [odds ratio (JR) 5.78; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.68–9.80; P {\textless} 0.0001]. Tumors with non-circumscribed margins, posterior acoustic shadowing, and high vascularity were more likely to be luminal B subtype (JR 2.88; 95\% CI 2–4.14; P- {\textless}0.0001). Tumors with microcalcification and posterior mixed acoustic pattern were strongly associated to be HER2-positive (JR 5.48; 95\% CI 3.06–9.80; P {\textless} 0.0001). Tumors with circumscribed margins and posterior acoustic enhancement were highly suggestive of triple-negative breast cancer (JR 7.06; 95\% CI 4.64–10.73; P {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusion: Microcalcification detected on mammography and certain ultrasound features such as circumscribed or non-circumscribed margins, posterior acoustic features, and vascularity are strongly correlated in predicting the molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and thus may further expand the role of conventional breast imaging.},

Their use in image classification tasks is still somewhat limited since researchers have so far chosen Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification and transformers were more targeted to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review that shows the differences between Vision Transformers (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Networks. The state of the art that used the two architectures for image classification was reviewed and an attempt was made to understand what factors may influence the performance of the two deep learning architectures based on the datasets used, image size, number of target classes (for the classification problems), hardware, and evaluated architectures and top results. The objective of this work is to identify which of the architectures is the best for image classification and under what conditions. This paper also describes the importance of the Multi-Head Attention mechanism for improving the performance of ViT in image classification.},

    abstract = {Human breast tumours are diverse in their natural history and in their responsiveness to treatments. Variation in transcriptional programs accounts for much of the biological diversity of human cells and tumours. In each cell, signal transduction and regulatory systems transduce information from the cell's identity to its environmental status, thereby controlling the level of expression of every gene in the genome. Here we have characterized variation in gene expression patterns in a set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumours from 42 different individuals, using complementary DNA microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. These patterns provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumour. Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. Sets of co-expressed genes were identified for which variation in messenger RNA levels could be related to specific features of physiological variation. The tumours could be classified into subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns.},

In this study, we have refined the previously defined subtypes of breast tumors that could be distinguished by their distinct patterns of gene expression. A total of 115 malignant breast tumors were analyzed by hierarchical clustering based on patterns of expression of 534 “intrinsic” genes and shown to subdivide into one basal-like, one ERBB2-overexpressing, two luminal-like, and one normal breast tissue-like subgroup. The genes used for classification were selected based on their similar expression levels between pairs of consecutive samples taken from the same tumor separated by 15 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment. Similar cluster analyses of two published, independent data sets representing different patient cohorts from different laboratories, uncovered some of the same breast cancer subtypes. In the one data set that included information on time to development of distant metastasis, subtypes were associated with significant differences in this clinical feature. By including a group of tumors from BRCA1 carriers in the analysis, we found that this genotype predisposes to the basal tumor subtype. Our results strongly support the idea that many of these breast tumor subtypes represent biologically distinct disease entities.},

Lacking gene expression data, surrogate classifications based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) have been proposed. A recent St. Gallen consensus meeting recommends to use this “surrogate intrinsic subtypes” for predicting adjuvant chemotherapy resistance, implying that “Surrogate Luminal A” breast cancers should only receive endocrine therapy. In this study we assessed both gene expression based intrinsic subtypes as well as surrogate intrinsic subtypes regarding their power to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy benefit. Single institution data of 560 breast cancer patients were reviewed. Gene expression data was available for 247 patients. Subtypes were determined on the basis of IHC, Ki67, histological grade, endocrine responsiveness, and gene expression, and were correlated with chemotherapy response and recurrence-free survival. In ER+/HER2− tumors, a high histological grade was the best predictor for chemotherapy benefit, both in terms of pCR (p = 0.004) and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.002). The gene expression based and surrogate intrinsic subtype based on Ki67 had no predictive or prognostic value in ER+/HER2− tumors. Histological grade, ER, PR, and HER2 were the best predictive factors for chemotherapy response in breast cancer. We propose to continue the conventional use of these markers.},

The 1980s saw an exponential increase in mammography with the implementation of yearly screening mammograms and overwhelming variation amongst radiology reports. BI-RADS was implemented to standardize risk assessment and quality control for mammography and provide uniformity in the reports for non-radiologist. The first version proposed included the suggested structure for a mammographic report, the lexicon for mammographic imaging findings, and final assessment category with recommendations for management. The ACR used scientific analysis and literature review to create a lexicon of descriptors that had shown to correlate with high predictive values associated with either benign or malignant disease. The second important aspect of the BI-RADS system was the category classification for the overall assessment of the imaging findings. The categorization provides an approximate risk of malignancy to a lesion from essentially zero to greater than 95\%. The categorization and final assessment decreased ambiguity in recommendations. BI-RADS was built to be fluid and change with the adaptation of new techniques and research. Such changes that have occurred are the inclusion of lexicons for ultrasound in 2003 and MRI in 2006. The latest edition is BI-RADS 5 (2013) and included six classifications for lesions.},
