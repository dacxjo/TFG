    abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

    abstract = {Early-stage cancer detection could reduce breast cancer death rates significantly in the long-term. The most critical point for best prognosis is to identify early-stage cancer cells. Investigators have studied many breast diagnostic approaches, including mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, computerized tomography, positron emission tomography and biopsy. However, these techniques have some limitations such as being expensive, time consuming and not suitable for young women. Developing a high-sensitive and rapid early-stage breast cancer diagnostic method is urgent. In recent years, investigators have paid their attention in the development of biosensors to detect breast cancer using different biomarkers. Apart from biosensors and biomarkers, microwave imaging techniques have also been intensely studied as a promising diagnostic tool for rapid and cost-effective early-stage breast cancer detection. This paper aims to provide an overview on recent important achievements in breast screening methods (particularly on microwave imaging) and breast biomarkers along with biosensors for rapidly diagnosing breast cancer.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease with multiple subtypes. The classification of these subtypes has evolved over the years. The most common and widely accepted classification of breast cancer is from an immunohistochemical perspective, based on the expression of the following hormone receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth factor (HER2). Accordingly, the following four subtypes of breast cancer are widely recognized: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and triple-negative. With the recent advances in cancer research, and an increased molecular understanding of breast cancer, the current clinical model for classification of breast cancer may be benefit from the addition of several molecular markers such as miRNAs (let-7, miR-155, miR-150, miR-153) and mutations (p53, BRCA 1 and 2 genes). This chapter provides an overview of the characteristics of these four subtypes of breast cancer.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer is characterized by abnormal discontinuities in the lining cells of a woman’s milk duct. Large numbers of women die from breast cancer as a result of developing symptoms in the milk ducts. If the diagnosis is made early, the death rates can be decreased. For radiologists and physicians, manually analyzing mammography images for breast cancer become time-consuming. To prevent manual analysis and simplify the work of classification, this paper introduces a novel hybrid DenseNet121-based Extreme Learning Machine Model (ELM) for classifying breast cancer from mammogram images. The mammogram images were processed through preprocessing and data augmentation phase. The features were collected separately after the pooling and flatten layer at the first stage of the classification. Further, the features are fed as input to the proposed DenseNet121-ELM model’s fully connected layer as input. An extreme learning machine model has replaced the fully connected layer. The weights of the extreme learning machine have been updated by the AdaGrad optimization algorithm to increase the model’s robustness and performance. Due to its faster convergence speed than other optimization techniques, the AdaGrad algorithm optimization was chosen. In this research, the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset mammogram images were utilized, and the results are presented. We have considered the batch size of 32, 64, and 128 for the performance measure, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and computational time. The proposed DenseNet121+ELM model achieves 99.47\% and 99.14\% as training accuracy and testing accuracy for batch size 128. Also, it achieves specificity, sensitivity, and computational time of 99.37\%, 99.94\%, and 159.7731 minutes, respectively. Further, the comparison result of performance measures is presented for batch sizes 32, 64, and 128 to show the robustness of the proposed DenseNet121+ELM model. The automatic classification performance of the DenseNet121+ELM model has much potential to be applied to the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer.},

    abstract = {An automatic breast cancer detection and classification system plays an essential role in medical imaging applications. But accurate disease identification is one of the complicated processes due to the existence of noisy contents and irrelevant structure of the original images. In conventional works, various medical image processing techniques have been developed for accurately classifying the types of breast cancer. Still, it confronts difficulties due to the aspects of increased complexity in computations, error values, false positives, and misclassification outputs. Hence, this research work proposes to develop an optimization-based classification system for the breast cancer identification system. Here, the Gaussian filtering and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) techniques are utilized for preprocessing the original mammogram images by eliminating the noisy contents and enhancing the contrast of an image. Then, the Markov Random Adaptive Segmentation (MRAS) technique is employed for detecting the boundary region based on the random value selection. To make the classifying procedure easier, the set of features is optimally extracted from the segmented region with the help of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). In which, the global best fitness value is estimated by using the crossover, mutation, and selection operations. Finally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification technique is utilized for categorizing the image as to whether normal or abnormal with its type. The entire performance analysis of the suggested model is validated and compared using multiple measures during the evaluation. In the proposed method GA performs feature selection and prunes unnecessary features. The major goal is to improve the classification performance while reducing the number of features used. The proposed system GA-CNN provides improved performance results with a reduced error rate.The suggested GA-CNN increases accuracy (98.5), sensitivity (99.38), and specificity values (98.4) as compared to the existing technique by effectively identifying the classed label.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer has affected many women worldwide. To perform detection and classification of breast cancer many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been established because the inspection of the mammogram images by the radiologist is a difficult and time taken task. To early diagnose the disease and provide better treatment lot of CAD systems were established. There is still a need to improve existing CAD systems by incorporating new methods and technologies in order to provide more precise results. This paper aims to investigate ways to prevent the disease as well as to provide new methods of classification in order to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women’s lives. The best feature optimization is performed to classify the results accurately. The CAD system’s accuracy improved by reducing the false-positive rates.The Modified Entropy Whale Optimization Algorithm (MEWOA) is proposed based on fusion for deep feature extraction and perform the classification. In the proposed method, the fine-tuned MobilenetV2 and Nasnet Mobile are applied for simulation. The features are extracted, and optimization is performed. The optimized features are fused and optimized by using MEWOA. Finally, by using the optimized deep features, the machine learning classifiers are applied to classify the breast cancer images. To extract the features and perform the classification, three publicly available datasets are used: INbreast, MIAS, and CBIS-DDSM. The maximum accuracy achieved in INbreast dataset is 99.7\%, MIAS dataset has 99.8\% and CBIS-DDSM has 93.8\%. Finally, a comparison with other existing methods is performed, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other approaches.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women, with molecular subtypes significantly influencing prognosis and treatment strategies. Currently, identifying the molecular subtype of cancer requires a biopsy—a specialized, expensive, and time-consuming procedure, often yielding to results that must be supported with additional biopsies due to technique errors or tumor heterogeneity. This study introduces a novel approach for predicting breast cancer molecular subtypes using mammography images and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. Using the OPTIMAM imaging database, 1397 images from 660 patients were selected. The pretrained deep learning model ResNet-101 was employed to classify tumors into five subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B1, Luminal B2, HER2, and Triple Negative. Various classification strategies were studied: binary classifications (one vs. all others, specific combinations) and multi-class classification (evaluating all subtypes simultaneously). To address imbalanced data, strategies like oversampling, undersampling, and data augmentation were explored. Performance was evaluated using accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Binary classification results showed a maximum average accuracy and AUC of 79.02\% and 64.69\%, respectively, while multi-class classification achieved an average AUC of 60.62\% with oversampling and data augmentation. The most notable binary classification was HER2 vs. non-HER2, with an accuracy of 89.79\% and an AUC of 73.31\%. Binary classification for specific combinations of subtypes revealed an accuracy of 76.42\% for HER2 vs. Luminal A and an AUC of 73.04\% for HER2 vs. Luminal B1. These findings highlight the potential of mammography-based AI for non-invasive breast cancer subtype prediction, offering a promising alternative to biopsies and paving the way for personalized treatment plans.},

    abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with distinct molecular subtypes, each requiring tailored therapeutic strategies. Accurate classification of these subtypes is crucial for optimizing treatment and improving patient outcomes. While immunohistochemistry remains the gold standard for subtyping, it is invasive and may not fully capture tumor heterogeneity. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep Learning (DL), offers a promising non-invasive alternative by analyzing medical imaging data. Methods: In this study, we propose a multimodal DL model that integrates mammography images with clinical metadata to classify breast lesions into five categories: benign, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and triple-negative. Using the publicly available Chinese Mammography Database (CMMD), our model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 4056 images from 1775 patients. Results: The proposed multimodal approach significantly outperformed a unimodal model based solely on mammography images, achieving an AUC of 88.87\% for multiclass classification of these five categories, compared to 61.3\% AUC for the unimodal model. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of multimodal AI-driven approaches for non-invasive breast cancer subtype classification, paving the way for improved diagnostic precision and personalized treatment strategies.},
